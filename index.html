    <p>Cookies and cream icecream is not as good as mint chocolate chip. We could suggest that cake batter is a better flavor but that is new so it would not be the best to do so. Vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry <i>can</i> be good by themselves but caramel or chocolate sauces can work well with these flavors. <b>When will we get some honey icecream?</b> Geez, man. You know like honey with maybe some crunchy bits in it. It would be <u>delicious~!</u></p>
